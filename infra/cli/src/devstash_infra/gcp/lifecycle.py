"""gcp/lifecycle.py — the environment bring-up / teardown orchestrators.

CLI zone (3.14). Ports run.sh's `up()` / `_apply_with_overlap()` / `_apply_and_wire()` + the two
staging pre-applies (`_apply_ci_identity` / `_apply_ar_push_target` + `_wait_ar_push_ready`), plus
suspend.sh's `suspend()` / `resume()` / `_apply_and_wire_cluster_overlapped()`. A `Lifecycle`
collaborator that threads the already-ported pieces: `Environment` (apply lifecycle +
`staging_apply`), `Deploy` (the CI-overlap driver: predispatch → cancel-on-error → watch),
`Secrets` (the GitHub push), `Dns` (the A-record), `Bootstrap` (up's prerequisites), `Db` (the
dump/restore [#4/#5]) and `Teardown` (the NEG reap).

THE OVERLAP, in one sentence: the deploy-gke build-push job authenticates via WIF/AR and has NO
dependency on Cloud SQL, so we apply JUST the WIF/deployer-SA/AR-repo subgraph first (~1 min), push
the GitHub secrets, DISPATCH the build, then run the full apply in parallel with it — instead of
leaving `deploy` a serial manual step behind the whole provision. `cancel_run_on_error` reaps the
orphaned build if the apply dies before the hand-off; a `ClusterUnreachable` timeout is spared (the
build's own waits may still carry it home). `resume` wraps its phases in a `span` for timed
narration; `suspend` dumps+verifies the DB [#4] BEFORE the destroying apply.
